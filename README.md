This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud development environment that provides all the functionality of VS Code without requiring any local setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice directly from your browser, on any machine, at any time. However, to streamline your programming workflow, it is still highly recommended to install and configure VS Code locally.
